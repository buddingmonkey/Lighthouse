/*
 * Jiggies of Time Fun Facts
 *
 * The Collywobble actor is marker-swapped to prevent a spawn. This is rarely seen anyway, since BB enforces
 * file select as the default boot. With vanilla, if you were to view the intro sequence after a game over,
 * you'd see a stray Collywobble spawned during the concert when it shouldn't be there at all.
 *
 * An unused vanilla marker 0x54 spawns ASSET_50B_MODEL_X_BARREL_TOP, which in Jiggies of Time is model-swapped
 * with a random honeycomb drop.
 *
